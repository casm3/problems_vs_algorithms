# Rearrange Array Elements

Here a well known divide and conquer algorithms was used to sort the given input_list (recursive quicksort) with general O(nlog(n)). Merge sort could have also been used, same for tim sort.

Another help function named splitter was applied to the sorted array to find the max first and second number that can be made from the array.

Once again the space complexity is O(1), we are dealing with a few integer variables.
