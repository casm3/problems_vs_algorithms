# Square Root

The square root of an integer number can be found through [Newton's Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) in O(log(n)) time complexity.

Also, the _//_ was used to pick up only the integer part of the division. A cast could have been used.

Three integers variables were used, and this number will be used for sqrt of either 10, 100, 1000000. So O(1) space complexity.
