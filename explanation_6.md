# Max and Min in a Unsorted Array

By using the same traversal we may find both min and max value in an array (O(n)). Just by adding two comparisons inside the for loop.

Once again the space complexity is O(1) due to the fact that we are dealing with at most three integers variables here: value, min and max.
