# Autocomplete with Tries

The Trie problem was also well explored by this section.

And the only additional method here was the suffixes.

The average time complexity to find or insert an element here is O(1), relying on a hashmap as base data-structure.

Already the suffix method may take O(n) in the given implementation. Sets could have been used to reduce this complexity to O(1) as well.
