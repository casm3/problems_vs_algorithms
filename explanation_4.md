# Dutch National Flag Problem

The same problem has been well explored during this section. With only three numbers in the array we may base our implementation in three indexes: low, high and pivot.

Then, by using the powerful swap native Python technique we can finish the problem in a complexity no bigger than O(n)

Once again the space complexity here is O(n), we are dealing with an array of integers. The three integers variables here (pivot, low and high) have little or no impact over the overall space complexity when dealing with larger arrays.
